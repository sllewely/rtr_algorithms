# Linked List

A fundamental data structure, used by many other data structures.

We implemented a linked list and talked about different considerations, for example:
* How long would it take to add an item to the end of a linked list, if I only knew the head of the list but not the tail?
* How long would it take to search a sorted linked list worst case?
* Search for an item in an unsorted list worst case?
etc
